MERGE
-----
1. Update development certs screenshot

2. Complete README sequence since steps are not intuitive yet
   Get Elastic components working and pointing to an empty folder:
   - logaggregation.elasticsearch
   - apilogs
   
   Requires build.sh followed by deploy.sh

   Then just describe two scenarios with diagrams and links to further info:
   - Populate logs from API tests
   - Populate logs by running SPA against API

   This keeps this repo's responsibilities manageable

3. API logs path to be a sibling folder on local computer
   Remove GUID subfolder

4. See if I can remove utcTime after the Date processor
   Use one day old API logs folder so that times are clear

5. Tidy up resources and ensure queries are correct

FUTURE
------
1. Docker token handler to write log files

2. Final API blog posts to point to these two pages:
   - ElasticSearch aggregation
   - API Testing
   
3. APIs to log to /var/log/api in Docker containers

4. Get cloudnative deployment repo to use resources from here

5. Update Log Aggregation Setup blog post and describe processors

# Elasticsearch Log Aggregation

Resources for deploying the Elastic Stack so that it can be used to aggregate API logs.\
This is part of an overall [Effective API Logging](https://authguidance.com/effective-api-logging/) design.

## Docker Tutorial

See the [Elasticsearch Log Aggregation Setup](https://authguidance.com/log-aggregation-setup/) blog post, which explains the deployment behaviour.\
This uses a local Docker setup, and can also be used to ship logs when developing APIs locally.

## Kubernetes

The same techniques are then included in these Kubernetes based deployments:

- [Local Kubernetes End to End Deployment](https://github.com/gary-archer/oauth.cloudnative.local)
- [AWS Kubernetes End to End Deployment](https://github.com/gary-archer/oauth.cloudnative.aws)
